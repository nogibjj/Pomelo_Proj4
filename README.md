# Project 4

### Project Goal
In Project 4, I aimed to connect different cloud platforms and tried to use AWS App Runner and ECT. This entire project is pushed to AWS ECR and AWS app runner. Because I also turned the aws app runner's auto deploy function (now it is not showing because of termination). 

### Project Workflows
1. Build up Fast API based on Project 3, i.e., building up functions. 
2. Connecting to EC2 and AWS App Runner. 
3. Running the projects and testing.
